## üîç Introduction

The **Dc-1** CTF is designed for beginners and intermediate penetration testers. This guide will teach you how to:
1. Perform network discovery.
2. Identify and exploit vulnerabilities.
3. Gain shell access and escalate privileges to root.

This walkthrough is for educational purposes, helping you enhance your cybersecurity skills.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Netdiscover**: Identifies active hosts in the network using ARP requests.
- üåê **Nmap**: Scans for open ports, services, and vulnerabilities on the target system.
- üìö **SearchSploit**: Finds publicly available exploits in the Exploit Database.
- üíâ **Metasploit Framework (msfconsole)**: Executes exploits and manages payloads for penetration testing.

## üó∫Ô∏è Walkthrough Steps

### Step 1: Network Discovery with Netdiscover
Use **Netdiscover** to identify live systems in the subnet by sending ARP requests.

### Step 2: Port Scanning with Nmap
Run **Nmap** to scan for open ports, services, and vulnerabilities on the target system.

### Step 3: Finding Exploits with SearchSploit
Leverage **SearchSploit** to locate publicly available exploits for the identified vulnerabilities.

### Step 4: Setting Up Exploits with Metasploit
1. Open **msfconsole** and load the desired exploit.
2. Configure the following options:
   - `RHOSTS`: Target IP address.
   - `LHOST`: Attacker IP address.

### Step 5: Execute the Exploit
Run the exploit to gain initial access to the target system.

### Step 6: Gaining Shell Access
Use a Python script to spawn a shell. Employ commands like:
- `find` to check file permissions (`2>/dev/null` to suppress errors).
- `touch` to create files or directories for testing.

### Step 7: Privilege Escalation
1. Create and execute a file for privilege escalation.
2. Use `/bin/bash` to execute commands as root.
3. Successfully gain root access and retrieve the flag.
